**IMPORTANT:** This repo has to be considered archived. Everything that was here has now been merged into https://github.com/aciceri/nixfleet

Conceptually having my Emacs managed as a separated flake had advantages but I never fully exploited them since I've always used it as input
from the ~nixfleet~ repository, it became just a burden having to maintain two repos.

I'm leaving the repository here for historical purposes.

* My opinionated Emacs

This is a Nix flake to build my Emacs.
